This is a cozy, doodle-themed community chat application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app prioritizes:

## Design Philosophy

- **Cuteness and comfort over complexity** - Every interaction should feel warm and welcoming
- **Hand-drawn aesthetic** - Use soft lines, pastel colors, and doodle-style graphics
- **Emotional warmth** - Features that make users feel supported and valued
- **Simplicity** - Easy to use, non-intimidating interface

## Visual Style Guidelines

- **Colors**: Soft pastels (pinks, lilacs, baby blues, warm yellows)
- **Typography**: Rounded, friendly fonts (Comic Neue, Nunito, Cabin Sketch style)
- **Animations**: Gentle, bouncy, never jarring
- **Graphics**: Hand-drawn doodles, simple line art, cute characters

## Core Features

1. Simple doodle avatar login system
2. MSN-style public chatroom with nostalgia vibes
3. Animated doodle stickers and reactions
4. Mood-based UI themes (client-side only)
5. "Are you leaving me?" exit page
6. Tip jar integration (Ko-fi/Patreon support page)
7. Wholesome notifications and mini-profiles

## Technical Approach

- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks to keep it simple)
- Local storage for user preferences and themes
- CSS animations for smooth, cozy transitions
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Static deployment friendly (no backend required for basic functionality)

When generating code, always prioritize the cozy, welcoming feeling over technical complexity.
